Ruby has number of convenience functions that I have grown to appreciate. For example when checking the length if the length of a string is zero, in most programming languages the most common thing is to do this: mystring.length == 0. In ruby, you can do: mystring.length.zero?. Another cool one, is when checking if a value is less than zero, instead of myvalue < 0 you can do myvalue.negative?
