# Introduction

I will be the first to admit that I don't get it. I find it cumbersome to work with. I don't exactly understand what they mean when they talk non-blockin i/o. Aren't all servers/frameworks non-blocking? I'm genuinely failing to see the point. What am I taking about. I'm taking about reactive programming or is it reactive extensions, not sure. Any way I will be focusing on trying to understand and make sense of reactive programming using the implementation of projectreactor.io and spring boot.
